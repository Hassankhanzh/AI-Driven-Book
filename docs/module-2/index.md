# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module focuses on digital twin simulation using Gazebo and Unity, teaching you how to create virtual representations of humanoid robots that accurately simulate physics, environments, and sensor systems with proper integration to ROS 2.

## Overview

Digital twin technology is essential for developing and testing humanoid robots in a safe, cost-effective virtual environment. In this module, you will learn:

- How to create realistic physics simulations using Gazebo
- How to design virtual environments and implement human-robot interaction in Unity
- How to simulate various robot sensors and integrate them with ROS 2

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of ROS 2 basics (covered in [Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](/docs/module-1))
- Basic familiarity with simulation concepts
- Access to computing resources capable of running Gazebo and Unity simulations

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Configure Gazebo physics simulations with accurate gravity, collision detection, and humanoid dynamics
- Create Unity environments that properly render robot environments and interact with ROS 2 systems
- Simulate sensor data (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs) that matches real-world behavior and integrates with ROS 2
