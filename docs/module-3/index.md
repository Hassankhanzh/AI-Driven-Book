# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module focuses on advanced perception, navigation, and training for humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac technology.

## Overview

In this module, you'll learn about:

- **Isaac Sim**: Photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation for robotics AI
- **Isaac ROS Perception**: Hardware-accelerated perception pipelines including VSLAM
- **Nav2 for Humanoid Planning**: Path planning with locomotion constraints for humanoid robots

This module builds on your knowledge of ROS 2 and simulation concepts from the previous modules, diving deep into NVIDIA's Isaac ecosystem for advanced robotics applications.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Completed Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- Completed Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- Understanding of ROS 2 concepts and simulation environments
- Basic familiarity with NVIDIA Isaac concepts

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Set up and configure Isaac Sim for photorealistic robotics simulation
2. Implement Isaac ROS perception pipelines with hardware acceleration
3. Configure Nav2 for humanoid-specific navigation with locomotion constraints
4. Generate synthetic datasets using Isaac Sim for AI training
5. Integrate perception and navigation systems for humanoid robot applications

Let's begin with exploring Isaac Sim and synthetic data generation.
