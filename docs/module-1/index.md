# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module introduces the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) as the middleware that connects AI logic to humanoid robot control.

## Overview

ROS 2 serves as the communication backbone for robotic systems, enabling different components to interact seamlessly. In this module, you will learn:

- The fundamentals of ROS 2 architecture
- How to implement Python AI agents that communicate with robots
- How to model humanoid robots using URDF

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of AI concepts
- Familiarity with distributed systems (helpful but not required)

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Explain the core concepts of ROS 2 architecture (nodes, topics, services, actions)
- Implement Python-based AI agents using rclpy
- Create and modify URDF files for humanoid robot models
