# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Welcome to Module 4 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module focuses on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems that integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) with robotics to enable humanoid robots to convert natural language and visual input into physical actions.

## Overview

In this module, you'll learn about:

- **[Voice-to-Action Interfaces](./voice-to-action-interfaces)**: Implementing speech recognition and natural language command parsing
- **[LLM-Driven Cognitive Planning](./llm-driven-cognitive-planning)**: Translating language into robot action sequences
- **[Capstone: The Autonomous Humanoid](./capstone-autonomous-humanoid)**: End-to-end VLA pipeline integration

This module builds on your knowledge of robotics, simulation, and navigation concepts from the previous modules, diving deep into the integration of AI and robotics for natural human-robot interaction.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Completed Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (robotics basics)
- Completed Module 2: The Digital Twin (simulation concepts)
- Completed Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (navigation and perception knowledge)
- Understanding of robotics concepts and simulation environments

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Implement voice-to-action interfaces that convert speech commands to robot actions
2. Create cognitive planning systems that translate natural language to robot behaviors
3. Integrate voice, vision, and action systems in a complete autonomous humanoid
4. Apply safety validation between LLM outputs and robot execution
5. Build end-to-end VLA pipelines in simulation environments

Let's begin with exploring Voice-to-Action Interfaces.
