  Successfully completed the implementation of Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™).

  All tasks from the tasks.md file have been completed and marked as finished:
  - Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003) - All completed
  - Phase 2: Foundational (T004-T006) - All completed
  - Phase 3: User Story 1 - Isaac Sim & Synthetic Data (T007-T013) - All completed
  - Phase 4: User Story 2 - Isaac ROS Perception (T014-T021) - All completed
  - Phase 5: User Story 3 - Nav2 Humanoid Planning (T022-T030) - All completed
  - Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns (T031-T037) - All completed

  The implementation includes:
  - Complete Module 3 with 4 content files (index, Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Nav2)
  - Updated sidebar navigation with all 4 chapters
  - All content validated and Docusaurus build verified
  - All tasks marked as completed in tasks.md

  Module 3 covers Isaac Sim for synthetic data generation, Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated perception, and Nav2 for humanoid-specific navigation planning.
outcome: "Complete Module 3 implementation with all tasks marked as completed"
evaluation: "All tasks in the tasks.md file have been successfully completed. The implementation includes all required content for Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS perception, and Nav2 humanoid planning. The Docusaurus build passes successfully and all content is properly integrated into the navigation structure. All requirements from the original specification have been met."
